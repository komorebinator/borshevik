# Fedora Universal Blue – Custom Image

This is the beginning of my personal custom image project based on [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and Fedora Silverblue.

## 🧩 Purpose

The goal is to create a Fedora-based immutable image that is **pre-configured for my own needs**, making setup and maintenance a breeze across machines.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

This project is in its early stages. Planned features include:

- ✅ Personal configuration and dotfiles baked into the image
- 🔜 Pre-installed multimedia **codecs**
- 🔜 Integrated **tunneling software** (VPN/SSH tools)
- 🔜 **Google Chrome** provided by default

## 🚧 Status

**Early development** – the image currently only contains a basic setup, but it lays the foundation for a more feature-complete custom build.

## ⚙️ Usage (WIP)

Instructions for using or building this image will be added soon.

Stay tuned!
